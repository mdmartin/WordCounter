This is a file to test our project. It will do the average of the number of words per sentence;
by default we will have a minimal size for the words taken into account. We also have by default some delimiters. To do a good testing, we need to add some delimiters, like the one I just put. 
We also have to try some tricks like an end of line

in the middle of the sentence.


This text is small so we can try the difficult cases.
