The introduction explains what are the different steps of Rapid Contextual Design (CD): contextual inquiry, interpretation, model consolidation and affinity diagram building, building personas (addition to the original CD), visioning, storyboarding, user interface design (not covered in the book) and paper prototypes and mock-up interviews. The Rapid CD focuses on the core CD techniques. As including users in the design process extends the time required companies are reluctant to do it, time is an important factor in business. Rapid CD lets you see if it can be integrated in your existing design process and what you can do in a limited amount of time by skipping some non relevant steps in the context. In fact the increased speed come from the flexibility of Rapid CD. As for every new process your very first challenge will probably be to convince your company to adopt it. 
Chapter 2 aims to plan up-front your Rapid CD project: which team will work on it? What will be the schedule? How to deal with stakeholders and predefined software methodology in place? The book suggests 3 processes as basis and details some sample schedules: Lighting Fast, Lightning Fast + and Focused Rapid CD. But remember than you always can adapt to your needs and constraints and plan your own Rapid CD project. These three typical processes differ by the time they require: the number of contextual inquiry interviews varies and some steps may be skipped. Rapid CD fits best with projects the scope of which isn't too broad and when parts to be designed are clearly identified. Rapid CD projects usually rely on a 2-person full-time team and some helpers are welcome for some steps. The expertise of these two people should be complementary and it could be any combination of UI designer, developer and work practice professional. One other important point is to know your stakeholders: you must be aware of their expectations and worries, and a key point is to communicate well with them on the progress, on the design... One good point for Rapid CD is it can generally easily fit into any software development methodology in place: e.g. Rapid CD will be well integrated with Rational Unified Process or Extreme Programming.
Chapter 3 is about preparing the first step of Rapid CD, contextual interviews. The main point is to find the right sample of people to be able to highlight key characteristics from them. As your participant numbers should remain small (4 to 12) the choice must be very relevant. The very first step is to identify the activity you want to support and then to identify who is involved in making it happen. You may also want to have a look to indirect users: think to the relationships between people and tasks. When the job roles you want to interview are decided you have then to choose contexts: take them as different as possible. Of course how much a given context matters highly depends on your project. You also have to think to the style of the interview: as it depends on the nature of the process you are studying you should adapt (e.g. is it ok to often interrupt the task?). More generally conducting an interview requires some logistic and you should try hard to make everything smooth, the quality of the data collected also depends on this. Take also care of legal aspects. Finally you have to actually find some people to take part in the interview! Some incentives may be needed to motivate people. Be sure to put forward a clear description of what project is and what implies the interview. You should also qualify your interview candidates to check that they are the good persons you are looking for. When interviews are scheduled write down all the information and share with all the interviewers. To sum up: you must analyze who you are looking for (job roles and contexts) and then find people and care about the logistic problems.
Now it's time for the contextual inquiry (CI) interviews, the base of every Rapid CD project. The best configuration for an interview is one-to-one and it should last about two hours. It's a good idea to give an introductory group talk (with the interviewees and the managers) first to clarify again what will be going on. When conducting a CI interview there are four key concepts to keep in mind: context, partnership, interpretation and focus. You must understand the user in his original context, the interview must take place in real conditions (environment, tasks...). You want to get details of the tasks so be aware when the user talk in abstraction or summarize. You should act like an apprentice during the interview, learning from the user how things work (he is the expert). To be sure to interpret things right you should share your understanding with the user so he can correct you. Finally you must stay focused on your project, be adaptive, build your interview on the answers of the user: it's crucial to have a deep and accurate understanding of particular points, not a broad overview. In practice, your interview must begin with an introduction, it's the occasion to make the user feel comfortable, set expectations and find where to start with. Then takes place the field interview. Your job is to observe, discuss and capture everything you think is interesting: take notes, collect relevant artifacts and picture the workspace. You may also share ideas of design in live. At the end of the interview make sure to wrap up: summarize what you learned and thank the user! Scheduling quickly the interpretation phase is a good idea, ideally it should be done in the 48 hours following the interviews.
I would like to come back in more details on one of the most important point: the field interview. Mastering this step is indeed critical and success often lies in details. The detail which caught my attention is the importance of practical aspects, how the use of one particular tool may have a deep impact on the data you get. About half of the points in the field interview section of the book is dedicated to logistic advice.
To keep track of things it's recommended to simply take notes with a pen and a notebook. It may sound a little archaic and painful. But it's the best non intrusive method. The tools you use have a significant impact on the actions of the user. The first tool you would think to use to take notes is computer, but it is a bad idea. A laptop put a barrier between you and the user: you have the feeling to be hidden by the screen, and the user has the feeling that you are more distant. It's counterproductive, remember that you must establish a true partnership with the interviewee. It's a virtual barrier but it has real psychological impact and data collected may be impaired. The same kind of trouble is likely to occur if you intend to videotape the interview. The weight of the camera's gaze will certainly modify the user's behavior.

You must understand the user in his original context, the interview must take place in real conditions (environment, tasks...). You want to get details of the tasks so be aware when the user talk in abstraction or summarize. You should act like an apprentice during the interview, learning from the user how things work (he is the expert). To be sure to interpret things right you should share your understanding with the user so he can correct you. Finally you must stay focused on your project, be adaptive, build your interview on the answers of the user: it's crucial to have a deep and accurate understanding of particular points, not a broad overview. In practice, your interview must begin with an introduction, it's the occasion to make the user feel comfortable, set expectations and find where to start with. Then takes place the field interview. Your job is to observe, discuss and capture everything you think is interesting: take notes, collect relevant artifacts and picture the workspace. You may also share ideas of design in live. At the end of the interview make sure to wrap up: summarize what you learned and thank the user! Scheduling quickly the interpretation phase is a good idea, ideally it should be done in the 48 hours following the interviews.
I would like to come back in more details on one of the most important point: the field interview. Mastering this step is indeed critical and success often lies in details. The detail which caught my attention is the importance of practical aspects, how the use of one particular tool may have a deep impact on the data you get. About half of the points in the field interview section of the book is dedicated to logistic advice.
To keep track of things it's recommended to simply take notes with a pen and a notebook. It may sound a little archaic and painful. But it's the best non intrusive method. The tools you use have a significant impact on the actions of the user. The first tool you would think to use to take notes is computer, but it is a bad idea. A laptop put a barrier between you and the user: you have the feeling to be hidden by the screen, and the user has the feeling that you are more distant. It's counterproductive, remember that you must establish a true partnership with the interviewee. It's a virtual barrier but it has real psychological impact and data collected may be impaired. The same kind of trouble is likely to occur if you intend to videotape the interview. The weight of the camera's gaze will certainly modify the user's behavior.
The introduction explains what are the different steps of Rapid Contextual Design (CD): contextual inquiry, interpretation, model consolidation and affinity diagram building, building personas (addition to the original CD), visioning, storyboarding, user interface design (not covered in the book) and paper prototypes and mock-up interviews. The Rapid CD focuses on the core CD techniques. As including users in the design process extends the time required companies are reluctant to do it, time is an important factor in business. Rapid CD lets you see if it can be integrated in your existing design process and what you can do in a limited amount of time by skipping some non relevant steps in the context. In fact the increased speed come from the flexibility of Rapid CD. As for every new process your very first challenge will probably be to convince your company to adopt it. 
Chapter 2 aims to plan up-front your Rapid CD project: which team will work on it? What will be the schedule? How to deal with stakeholders and predefined software methodology in place? The book suggests 3 processes as basis and details some sample schedules: Lighting Fast, Lightning Fast + and Focused Rapid CD. But remember than you always can adapt to your needs and constraints and plan your own Rapid CD project. These three typical processes differ by the time they require: the number of contextual inquiry interviews varies and some steps may be skipped. Rapid CD fits best with projects the scope of which isn't too broad and when parts to be designed are clearly identified. Rapid CD projects usually rely on a 2-person full-time team and some helpers are welcome for some steps. The expertise of these two people should be complementary and it could be any combination of UI designer, developer and work practice professional. One other important point is to know your stakeholders: you must be aware of their expectations and worries, and a key point is to communicate well with them on the progress, on the design... One good point for Rapid CD is it can generally easily fit into any software development methodology in place: e.g. Rapid CD will be well integrated with Rational Unified Process or Extreme Programming.
Chapter 3 is about preparing the first step of Rapid CD, contextual interviews. The main point is to find the right sample of people to be able to highlight key characteristics from them. As your participant numbers should remain small (4 to 12) the choice must be very relevant. The very first step is to identify the activity you want to support and then to identify who is involved in making it happen. You may also want to have a look to indirect users: think to the relationships between people and tasks. When the job roles you want to interview are decided you have then to choose contexts: take them as different as possible. Of course how much a given context matters highly depends on your project. You also have to think to the style of the interview: as it depends on the nature of the process you are studying you should adapt (e.g. is it ok to often interrupt the task?). More generally conducting an interview requires some logistic and you should try hard to make everything smooth, the quality of the data collected also depends on this. Take also care of legal aspects. Finally you have to actually find some people to take part in the interview! Some incentives may be needed to motivate people. Be sure to put forward a clear description of what project is and what implies the interview. You should also qualify your interview candidates to check that they are the good persons you are looking for. When interviews are scheduled write down all the information and share with all the interviewers. To sum up: you must analyze who you are looking for (job roles and contexts) and then find people and care about the logistic problems.
Now it's time for the contextual inquiry (CI) interviews, the base of every Rapid CD project. The best configuration for an interview is one-to-one and it should last about two hours.

Rapid CD fits best with projects the scope of which isn't too broad and when parts to be designed are clearly identified. Rapid CD projects usually rely on a 2-person full-time team and some helpers are welcome for some steps. The expertise of these two people should be complementary and it could be any combination of UI designer, developer and work practice professional. One other important point is to know your stakeholders: you must be aware of their expectations and worries, and a key point is to communicate well with them on the progress, on the design... One good point for Rapid CD is it can generally easily fit into any software development methodology in place: e.g. Rapid CD will be well integrated with Rational Unified Process or Extreme Programming.
Chapter 3 is about preparing the first step of Rapid CD, contextual interviews. The main point is to find the right sample of people to be able to highlight key characteristics from them. As your participant numbers should remain small (4 to 12) the choice must be very relevant. The very first step is to identify the activity you want to support and then to identify who is involved in making it happen. You may also want to have a look to indirect users: think to the relationships between people and tasks. When the job roles you want to interview are decided you have then to choose contexts: take them as different as possible. Of course how much a given context matters highly depends on your project. You also have to think to the style of the interview: as it depends on the nature of the process you are studying you should adapt (e.g. is it ok to often interrupt the task?). More generally conducting an interview requires some logistic and you should try hard to make everything smooth, the quality of the data collected also depends on this. Take also care of legal aspects. Finally you have to actually find some people to take part in the interview! Some incentives may be needed to motivate people. Be sure to put forward a clear description of what project is and what implies the interview. You should also qualify your interview candidates to check that they are the good persons you are looking for. When interviews are scheduled write down all the information and share with all the interviewers. To sum up: you must analyze who you are looking for (job roles and contexts) and then find people and care about the logistic problems.
Now it's time for the contextual inquiry (CI) interviews, the base of every Rapid CD project. The best configuration for an interview is one-to-one and it should last about two hours. It's a good idea to give an introductory group talk (with the interviewees and the managers) first to clarify again what will be going on. When conducting a CI interview there are four key concepts to keep in mind: context, partnership, interpretation and focus. You must understand the user in his original context, the interview must take place in real conditions (environment, tasks...). You want to get details of the tasks so be aware when the user talk in abstraction or summarize. You should act like an apprentice during the interview, learning from the user how things work (he is the expert). To be sure to interpret things right you should share your understanding with the user so he can correct you. Finally you must stay focused on your project, be adaptive, build your interview on the answers of the user: it's crucial to have a deep and accurate understanding of particular points, not a broad overview. In practice, your interview must begin with an introduction, it's the occasion to make the user feel comfortable, set expectations and find where to start with. Then takes place the field interview. Your job is to observe, discuss and capture everything you think is interesting: take notes, collect relevant artifacts and picture the workspace. You may also share ideas of design in live. At the end of the interview make sure to wrap up: summarize what you learned and thank the user! Scheduling quickly the interpretation phase is a good idea, ideally it should be done in the 48 hours following the interviews.
I would like to come back in more details on one of the most important point: the field interview. Mastering this step is indeed critical and success often lies in details. The detail which caught my attention is the importance of practical aspects, how the use of one particular tool may have a deep impact on the data you get. About half of the points in the field interview section of the book is dedicated to logistic advice.
To keep track of things it's recommended to simply take notes with a pen and a notebook. It may sound a little archaic and painful. But it's the best non intrusive method. The tools you use have a significant impact on the actions of the user. The first tool you would think to use to take notes is computer, but it is a bad idea. A laptop put a barrier between you and the user: you have the feeling to be hidden by the screen, and the user has the feeling that you are more distant. It's counterproductive, remember that you must establish a true partnership with the interviewee. It's a virtual barrier but it has real psychological impact and data collected may be impaired. The same kind of trouble is likely to occur if you intend to videotape the interview. The weight of the camera's gaze will certainly modify the user's behavior.
The introduction explains what are the different steps of Rapid Contextual Design (CD): contextual inquiry, interpretation, model consolidation and affinity diagram building, building personas (addition to the original CD), visioning, storyboarding, user interface design (not covered in the book) and paper prototypes and mock-up interviews. The Rapid CD focuses on the core CD techniques. As including users in the design process extends the time required companies are reluctant to do it, time is an important factor in business. Rapid CD lets you see if it can be integrated in your existing design process and what you can do in a limited amount of time by skipping some non relevant steps in the context. In fact the increased speed come from the flexibility of Rapid CD. As for every new process your very first challenge will probably be to convince your company to adopt it. 
Chapter 2 aims to plan up-front your Rapid CD project: which team will work on it? What will be the schedule? How to deal with stakeholders and predefined software methodology in place? The book suggests 3 processes as basis and details some sample schedules: Lighting Fast, Lightning Fast + and Focused Rapid CD. But remember than you always can adapt to your needs and constraints and plan your own Rapid CD project.

Scheduling quickly the interpretation phase is a good idea, ideally it should be done in the 48 hours following the interviews.
I would like to come back in more details on one of the most important point: the field interview. Mastering this step is indeed critical and success often lies in details. The detail which caught my attention is the importance of practical aspects, how the use of one particular tool may have a deep impact on the data you get. About half of the points in the field interview section of the book is dedicated to logistic advice.
To keep track of things it's recommended to simply take notes with a pen and a notebook. It may sound a little archaic and painful. But it's the best non intrusive method. The tools you use have a significant impact on the actions of the user. The first tool you would think to use to take notes is computer, but it is a bad idea. A laptop put a barrier between you and the user: you have the feeling to be hidden by the screen, and the user has the feeling that you are more distant. It's counterproductive, remember that you must establish a true partnership with the interviewee. It's a virtual barrier but it has real psychological impact and data collected may be impaired. The same kind of trouble is likely to occur if you intend to videotape the interview. The weight of the camera's gaze will certainly modify the user's behavior.
